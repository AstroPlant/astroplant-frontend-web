            AstroPlant is an educational citizen science project with the
            European Space Agency to engage a new generation of space farmers,
            collect data and ideas for agriculture on Mars, develop open source
            research equipment, and create awareness of regenerative and
            closed-loop life support systems. We have built a prototype plant
            lab that collects and shares open data about plant growth in
            different grow environments and are working on an open
            lab-infrastructure that makes it possible for everyone to contribute
            to science and space explorationâ€”and to get to know more about
            topics such as plant science and biology, space science,
            engineering, electronics, open innovation and the circular economy.
